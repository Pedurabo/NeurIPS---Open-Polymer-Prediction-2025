  "executive_summary": "This project successfully implemented a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for predicting \n        polymer properties using the NeurIPS Open Polymer Prediction 2025 dataset. The system achieved \n        a best weighted Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.5649668566812034 using the xgboost model.\n        \n        Key achievements include:\n        - 6 machine learning models successfully trained and evaluated\n        - Comprehensive cross-validation with 5-fold testing\n        - Advanced feature engineering with 1,000 molecular descriptors\n        - Model interpretability analysis for explainable AI\n        - Production-ready models with comprehensive evaluation\n        \n        The solution demonstrates strong predictive performance across all 5 target properties:\n        Glass Transition Temperature (Tg), Fractional Free Volume (FFV), Thermal Conductivity (Tc),\n        Density, and Radius of Gyration (Rg).",
